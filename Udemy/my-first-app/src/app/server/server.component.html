<p>{{ 'server' }} with ID {{ serverId }}</p>

<!--

String interpolation syntax is represented as {{ }} where you can write a TypeScript expression
The most common usage for using {{ }} is to reference a property stated in the typescript file, ie. server.component.ts

The other use case is that you can hard-code a string in the expression.
